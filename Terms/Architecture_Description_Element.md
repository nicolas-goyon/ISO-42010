An **AD element** is any construct in an [Architecture Description](Architecture_Description.md). By specializing **AD elements** to other information items, a project and/or organization could express all required [relations](Correspondence.md) of [architectural interest](Architecture_interest.md).
Every [Stakeholder](Stakeholder.md), [concern](Concern.md), [architecture viewpoint](Architecure_Viewpoint.md), [architecture view](Architecture_View.md), [system](System.md) [environment](Environment.md) and [architecture description](Architecture_Description.md) is considered and **AD Element**.

**AD elements** and their [relationships](Correspondence.md) are exposed in [Architectural Views](Architecture_View.md) in attempt to address [Stakeholder](Stakeholder.md) [Concerns](Concern.md).
