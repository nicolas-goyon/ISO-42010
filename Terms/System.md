# System

![The system and environment](../Resources/System-Environment.png)

**Systems** exist. A system is situated in its **[Environment](Environment.md)**. That **[environment](Environment.md)** could include other **Systems**.

The Standard takes no position on the question, *What is a system ?*
**Systems** can be man-made, natural or conceptual.
It could refer to :

- Enterprise
- System of systems
- Product line
- Service
- Subsystem
- Software

Nothing in the Standard depends upon a particular definition of system.
