# ISO-42010

## What is ISO 42010 for ?

ISO 42010 addresses the creation, analysis and sustainment of architectures of systems through the use of semantically rigorous architecture descriptions.

## Who made it ?

- ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010 was prepared by Joint Technical Committee ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC 7, Software and systems engineering
- In cooperation with the Software and Systems Engineering Standards Committee of the Computer Society of the IEEE
- And IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission)

## In short

[Architecture descriptions](Terms/Architecture_Description.md) exists to address known [concerns](Terms/Concern.md) for [system](Terms/System.md) [stakeholders](Terms/Stakeholder.md). *(The discipline of identifying [stakeholders](Terms/Stakeholder.md) and [concerns](Terms/Concern.md) has value far beyond architecting)*

[Architecture descriptions](Terms/Architecture_Description.md) helps scope the [Architectuer Model](Terms/Model.md) development : Controls costs, schedules and quality concerns to architecting.

Excplicitly architected [systems](Terms/System.md) seem to turn out faster, better and cheaper. *(Principles and procedures of rigorous architecting help manage the complexity faced by [stakeholders](Terms/Stakeholder.md) trying to understand [systems](Terms/System.md).)*

[Architecture](Terms/Architecture.md) modeling serves to make concepts concrete and formal, enhance documentation, and reduce the risk of [systems](Terms/System.md) development and acquisition.
